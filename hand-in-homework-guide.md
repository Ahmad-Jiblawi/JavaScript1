# How to hand in homework

From this module on you'll submit your homework only using GIT and GitHub.

1. [GitHub](https://www.github.com/HackYourFuture/JavaScript1)

## 1. GitHub homework guide

Follow the walkthrough to learn how to submit your homework for each week:

ONE TIME ONLY (START OF EVERY MODULE)

1. Create a [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) of the module repository. You do this by using the `fork` option on GitHub
2. Navigate to the URL of the cloned repository (it should be in your personal account, under "repositories")
3. Clone the repository, using SSH, to your local machine
4. On your local machine, navigate to the folder using the command line
5. Make sure you've cloned it correctly by running `git status` from the command line. You should see the following message:

[[ INSERT IMAGE OF HOW TO CHECK CLONE ]]

EVERY WEEK

5. Create a new branch for each week you have homework. For example, for the week 1 homework for JavaScript1 create a branch called `week-1-homework-YOUR_NAME`
6. Make your homework in the right folder, while in this branch
7. Once you're finished, add and commit everything. Make the commit message meaningful, for example `finished project for homework week1`
8. Push the branch to your forked repository
9. On GitHub, click on the `create pull request` button. Make sure the `base repository` is the original, on branch master
10. Give the pull request a title in the following format:

```markdown
js1 homework week 1 noerpaanakker
```

11. Submit the pull request from your forked repository branch into the `master` branch of the original repository
12. Do a little victory dance because you did it! Good job!
