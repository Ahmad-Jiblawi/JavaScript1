# Module #2 - JavaScript 1: Programming Basics (Frontend)

![JavaScript1](./assets/javascript1.png)

In this module you'll make a start into wonderful world of programming. We will be using the programming language `JavaScript` to do this. You'll learn about the basic buildings of programming: loops, functions, control flow and more. Consider these as the ABC's of programming, without them it's impossible to write working software!

Mostly what you'll be learning is 2 things:

- The skill of problem solving.
- The skill of thinking algorithmically

You will learn to understand problems terms of an algorithm: a series of steps that can be used to do a certain thing, even if the details are different each time.

## Learning goals

In order to successfully complete this module you will need to master the following:

- Have an idea of what computer programming is
- Learn about the basic buildings of JavaScript
- Correctly write variables, functions and loops
- Understand the control flow

## How to use this repository

> Before you do anything, first go [here](Week0/preparation.md).

This repository consists of 3 essential parts:

1. `Reading materials`: this document contains all the required theory you need to know _**while**_ you're coding. It's meant as both study material and as a reference to understand what you're doing.
2. `Homework`: this document contains the instructions for each week's homework.
3. `Lesson Plans`: this part is meant for teachers as a reference. However, as a student don't be shy to take a look at it as well!

After your first class you should start off with checking the `reading materials` for that week. At the beginning that would be the [Week 1 Reading](/Week1/README.md). Study all the concepts and try to get the gist of everything. After, you can get started with the `homework` for that week.

If you have any questions or if something is not entirely clear ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯, please ask/comment on Slack!

| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1.   | What is JavaScript?, Variables, Data Structures & Naming Conventions              | [Reading W1](/Week1/README.md) | [Homework W1](/Week1/MAKEME.md) | [Lesson Plan W1](/Week1/MAKEME.md) |
| 2.   | Statements vs. Expressions, Control flow, Loops, Operators, Conditional statement | [Reading W2](/Week2/README.md) | [Homework W2](/Week2/MAKEME.md) | [Lesson Plan W2](/Week1/MAKEME.md) |
| 3.   | Functions, Thinking like a programmer I                                           | [Reading W3](/Week3/README.md) | [Homework W3](/Week3/MAKEME.md) | [Lesson Plan W3](/Week1/MAKEME.md) |

**Kind note:**

We expect you to **always** come prepared to the class on Sunday.

### Overall

A good understanding of all the above mentioned topics. Want to check your Knowledge? Go through the [JavaScript Fundamentals README](../../../fundamentals/blob/master/README.md) and research/ ask for help (Slack!) with the concepts that are not entirely clear.
