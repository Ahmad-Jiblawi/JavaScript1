# Module #2 - JavaScript 1: Programming Basics (Frontend)

![JavaScript1](./assets/javascript1.png)

In this module you'll make a start into wonderful world of programming. We will be using the programming language `JavaScript` to do this. We will look at information in a different way: as

Mostly what you'll be learning is 2 things:

- The skill of problem solving.
- The skill of thinking algorithmically

You will learn to understand problems terms of an algorithm: a series of steps that can be used to do a certain thing, even if the details are different each time.

Here you can find course content and homework for the JavaScript 1 module
