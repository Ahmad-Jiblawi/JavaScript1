# Todo list

1. Practice the concepts
2. JavaScript exercises
3. Code along
4. PROJECT: Grade calculator
5. [OPTIONAL] Extra resources

## 1. Practice the concepts

In this section you will be doing interactice exercises, that will allow you to practice with the concepts you've learned about this week!

-   [Codecademy: Functions ](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/functions)
-   [Codecademy: Higher Order Functions](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/higher-order-functions/)

## 2. JavaScript exercises

In the following exercises you'll practice every concept you've learned about so far in this module.

Before you start, create a folder called `week2-scripts`. Inside, create 10 `.js` files, each dedicated to the exercises in this section. Make sure you give the files a name that reflects its content. For exercise an appropriate name would be: `greeting.js`.

**Exercise 1: You are [INSERT COMPLIMENT], Noer!**

There is no better way to start your day then with a compliment!

1. Write a function named `giveCompliment`

-   It takes 1 argument: your name
-   Inside the function create an array with 10 strings. Each string should be a compliment, like `"great"`, `"awesome"`

**Exercise 2: Dog years**

You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!

1. Write a function named calculateDogAge.

    - it takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
    - calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
    - outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"

2. Call the function three times with different sets of values.

**Exercise 3: Be your own fortune teller**

**Exercise 4: Shopping at the supermarket**

Let's do some grocery shopping! We're going to get some things to cook dinner with. However, you like to spend your money and always buy too many things. So when you have more than 5 items in your shopping cart the 

**Exercise 5:**
**Exercise 6:**
**Exercise 7:**
**Exercise 8:**
**Exercise 9:**

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

1. Take the following code
2. Write a function named tellFortune that:
    - takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
    - outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
3. Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

Exercise ideas:

-   Reverse a string
-   Reassign array index
-   Change object key value
-   Find the longest string in an array of strings
-   Sort an array of numbers from small to large number
-   Count the amount of occurrences of a letter in a string

## 3. Code along

In the following tutorial you'll learn how to make a Weight Converter application. You'll make use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. At first you'll be building the basic layout of the frontend (the HTML & CSS). After you'll start writing the JavaScript logic that will `convert pounds into grams`.

In order to speed up development you'll be using a CSS framework: [Bootstrap 4](https://www.getbootstrap.com). While coding along, have a look through the documentation in order to get familiar with the different class names to see what they do.

## 4. PROJECT: Grade calculator

> Every week ends with a project you have to build on your own. Instead of getting clear-cut instructions, you'll get a list of criteria that your project needs to measure up to.

In this project you'll write a script that calculates grades, based on the American grading system! Let's say a student did a test and they got a 60 out of 100, this script will:

1. convert the score into a percentage
2. calculate what grade corresponds with that percentage, and
3. shows in the command line the result: the grade and the percentage

When writing the script, make use of the following grade scores:

```markdown
Grade A (90% - 100%)
Grade B (80% - 89%)
Grade C (70% - 79%)
Grade D (60% - 69%)
Grade E (50% - 59%)
Grade F (0% - 49%)
```

These are the requirements your project needs to fulfill:

-   Make a JavaScript file with a name that describes its contents
-   Use at least one `function`, make sure it has a name that reflects what it does
-   Write at least 2 comments that explain to others what a line of code is meant to do
-   Use `node` from the command line to test if your code works as expected

This is what the script is expected to return in the command line:

```markdown
You got a B (85%)!
```

Hints:

-   Use either a switch or if/else statement
-   Make the return value of the function a template string, so you can insert variables!

## 5. [OPTIONAL] Extra resources

If you have time left over and feel like you could go for more practice, try out the following course:

-   [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

In this free course, you'll build 30 small projects that will sharpen your HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. Each project is meant to show you different ways you could use programming to make fun and useful things! Have fun!

## SUBMIT YOUR HOMEWORK!

After you've finished your todo list it's time to show us what you got! The homework that needs to be submitted is the following:

1. JavaScript exercises
2. PROJECT: Grade calculator

Upload both to your forked JavaScript1 repository in GitHub. Make a pull request to the original repository.
